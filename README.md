# Fourth World Map from Native Nations: The Survival of Fourth World Peoples (2nd Edition.) Edited by: Sharlotte Neeley
This is a map I made for a former professor at Northern Kentucky University. It is a fairly simple map but was made for black and white print in an academic text to desired specifications of the project.

# Daniel Ellis Western Route Map
This map was made during an independent study course at Northern Kentucky University for Professor Allen W. Ellis while completing my certificate in Geographic Information Systems. It was requested for a biography he was writing of his ancestor Daniel Ellis.

# Generic Leaflet Web Map (circa 2015)
This was made as an example of mapping experience during my co-op at Duke Energy in 2015. The version made for the company is more complex and has propritary data. I remade this in my own time for a web mapping and Javascript example. It marks my entry level Javascript Skills which have since greatly improved.

# Lund and Malm√∂ Wall Maps
These were made after my GIS course in 2019 at Lund Unviersity. I needed some home decor during my time living in sweden and saw some similar maps online in which I decided to replicate in ArcMap 10.4.

# Laser Scan of Flint Scraper & Photogrametric Model
These were made in my 2019 3D Archaeology course of a flint scraper I had from my parents backyard in Goshen KY. The two files represent a direct laser scan from a NextEngine 3D Scanner as well as a 3D model assembled via photogrametry assembled in MetaShape using photos taken with my Nikon D3300. The NextEngine 3D Scanner model can be viewer at: https://skfb.ly/6UVJ8
